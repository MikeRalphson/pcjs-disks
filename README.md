## PCjs Disk Archive

The [PCjs Disk Archive](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs-demo-disks) is a repository intended for use as a submodule with
the [PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs).  It is published [here](https://demo-disks.pcjs.org) for
use with the [PCjs Machines](https://www.pcjs.org/) website.

The goal is to migrate disks originally archived within the [PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs) to this
new repository and reduce the footprint of the original repository.

To use any of the disks archived here, visit the [PCjs Machines](https://www.pcjs.org/) website.
